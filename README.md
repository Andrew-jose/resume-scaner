This React component, App, forms the core of the Resume Reviewer web application, enabling users to upload a PNG image of their resume for AI-powered feedback. It manages the application's state, including the uploaded image (converted to Base64), the AI's review feedback, loading status, and any error messages. The component handles file input, validates that only PNG files are selected, displays a preview of the uploaded image, and orchestrates the asynchronous call to the Gemini 2.0 Flash API. This API call sends the image data to the AI model, which is instructed to first transcribe the resume text from the image and then generate constructive feedback on its content, structure, and clarity, displaying the comprehensive review in a dedicated section of the user interface once complete.
